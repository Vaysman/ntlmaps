Verison 0.9.8 - Fri May 17 04:07:20 MSD 2002
- internal redesign
- config file redesign
- fixed bug during HTTPS CONNECT authentication.
- fixed bug with UNICODE string conversion in NTLM msg3 creation code.
- no need in proxy port when proxy is not used
- fixed minor bug with an exception that was eraised if there was no http header
  in server's response.
- MSN Messenger and clients alike work again. It had been broken since APS 0.9.1
- minor bug in header remake (Proxy Connection -> Connection)
- fixed bug when client sends its header slowly and clients thread exits before
  doing anything useful. This was broken since version 0.9.7
- new optional value in config file NT_HOSTNAME (see comment in server.cfg).
- DOMAIN value in config is now NT_DOMAIN, to make it clear what domain name has
  to be used.
- implemented NTLM to BASIC translation. (it gives only one try to enter credentials now)

Verison 0.9.7 - Tue Dec 11 10:43:58 MSK 2001
- added ability to do multiple authentications in persistent connection. It looks like that
  there is some kind of NTLM extension that requires client to authenticate himself to every
  new network location even during persistent connection.
- fixed bug when request is sent to currently connected web server even if it is a request
  to different network location.
- 'Negotiate' authentication method name for www-authentication has been changed to 'NTLM'
  for compatibility with IIS/4.0
- added '-c' command line option to point to config file different than './server.cfg'
- AUTH_DEBUG option added. It makes APS write detailed report on NTLM authentication
  process.
- Highly experimental NTLM_FLAGS option allows changing NTLM flags in auth messages sent
  to remote server.

Verison 0.9.5 - Tue Nov 6 03:02:53 MSK 2001
- UNICODE string support during authorization (DOMAIN, USER, HOST).
- NT response is calculated now. Actually UNICODE and NT response are part of NTLM, but
  most of times everything works without them. See FULL_NTLM option in server.cfg
- some performance improvement (I hope).
- now it can behave as a standalone proxy server and do NTLM authentication at Web servers as
  well. While NTLM cannot pass through proxy server this option may be of use in intranet
  environment with athorization at local webservices. Just leave PARENT_PROXY option blank and
  it will connect to remote servers itself.

Verison 0.9.1 - Fri May 25 01:51:30 MSD 2001
- if one side closed connection server tries sending data left in the buffer
  before closing connection to the other side.
- new parameter in server.cfg - FRIENDLY_IPS that works
  in pair with ALLOW_EXTERNAL_CLIENTS:0. See server.cfg
- a bit improved POST of long files, but not completely perfect.

Verison 0.8.8 - Thu Apr 26 02:27:37 MSD 2001
- calls of socket.bind() and socket.connect() are compatible with Python >=1.6 now
- ALLOW_EXTERNAL_CLIENTS parameter in server.cfg to allow/disallow clients from external hosts
- NT password to use may be entered at the start time from the console (see server.cfg)
- calmed down debug info sent to console. Now it appears only if DEBUG is set to 1 in server.cfg

Verison 0.8.6 - Tue Apr 17 02:31:18 MSD 2001
- an ugly junkbuster's header delimiter '\012\012' worked around
- hopefully fixed bug with leakage of MS Proxy info page into response with requested resource
- value names are case insensitive now

Verison 0.8.3 - Wed Apr 11 22:46:40 MSD 2001
- POST and PUT should work with NTLM
- possibly there is a bug in proxy response header extracting routine

Verison 0.8.2 - Sun Apr  8 02:16:41 MSD 2001
- Tunnel mode for HTTPS 'CONNECT' request
- POST and PUT should work without authorization
- fixed some bugs
- POST does not work with NTLM authorization (working on this)

Version 0.8.0 - Thu Mar 29 03:12:41 MSD 2001
- First public release.
